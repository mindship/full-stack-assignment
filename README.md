## Problem Statement

Create `Pomodoro` application

The `Pomodoro Technique` is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

- After logging in, user should be taken to `dashboard`.
- The dashboard should contain list of `task cards`.
- The dashboard should contain actions `create task` button, `start button` (once clicked should start the timer of the tasks in order with a gap of 2 min for each task), `shuffle` button (once clicked the order of the tasks should change), `search` box.
- Each task card should display title, description, featured note.
- Each task card should contain actions: `start`, `stop`, `edit`, `delete`, `add note` buttons.
- If the user clicks on `view` button on task card, it should take them to task details page.
- User should be able to add notes to a task.


**Notes:**
- Application should be authenticated.
- Task should contain title, description, created at, completed at,duration, time remaining, Notes.
- Each note should contain text, created at, featured flag.

## Important Points to Note: 
- Your code has to be fully responsive & should work on all the devices (including mobile).
- We are really, really interested in your object oriented development skills, so please solve the problem keeping this in mind. Also handle the edge cases (if any).
- Your codebase should have the same level of structure and organised as any mature open source project including coding conventions, directory structure, INSTRUCTIONS.md with clear instructions and additionally a runner shell script that automates the entire build and execute process.
- You need to use Git for version control.
- Frequent commits are a huge plus.
- Do not check in vendor libraries or output from the build process. Use a standard build automation & dependency system like go modules/npm.
- Do not make your solution or this problem publicly available by, for example, using GitHub or Bitbucket or by posting this problem to a blog or forum.
